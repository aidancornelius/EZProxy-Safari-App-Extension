# EZProxy-Safari-App-Extension
An App Extension for EZProxy and OpenAthens proxy services as a Safari Extension for Safari 12+ on Mac. 

This Safari App Extension enables users to access academic journals through their institution's EZProxy or OpenAthens proxy service off campus.

## Ready-made version

If you have no idea what this is and just want the extension use the link below to download a ready made version from the Mac App Store.

[Download](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/ezproxy-for-safari/id1542011791?mt=12)

## Settings

By default the button, if enabled, without setting a proxy URL will point to the South Australian State Library. Make sure you set your institution's proxy in the EZProxy App first!

You can set up an OpenAthens proxy from the 'Advanced' tab. This is relatively new, so please get in touch if it's broken!
