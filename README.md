# EZProxy-Safari-App-Extension
An App Extension port of the EZProxy Safari Extension for Safari 12+

This is a Safari App Extension that allows users to access academic journals through their institutions EZProxy service.

## Prebuilt

If you have no idea what this stuff is, and just want the extension, use the releases tab to download a ready made version.

[Download](https://github.com/aidancornelius/EZProxy-Safari-App-Extension/releases)

## Installing

Drag the downloaded EZProxy app to your Applications folder
Open the freshly dragged EZProxy
Enter your library proxy address and save it
Open Safari, click on "Safari" in the menu bar, then Preferences
Go to Extensions, and enable "EZProxy Safari"

## Settings

By default the button, if enabled, without setting a proxy URL will point to a non-proxy website. Make sure you set your institutions proxy in the EZProxy App first!
